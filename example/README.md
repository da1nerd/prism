# Prism Examples

This directory contains a number of small examples on how to use Prism.

## Run an example

To run an example make sure you've installed the shards from the root directory.
```
shards install
```

Then you can run each of the examples. Run the following from the root directory or it won't pick up the prism library.
```
crystal example/example.cr
```

This is the box.cr sample
