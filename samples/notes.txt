- add a default camera
- add some form of primitives (rectangles, spheres, etc.)
- non-prespective views (orthongonal views)
- automatic shader selection
- make ambient light a component
- texture manipulation (translation, rotation, scale)
- more control over textures (filtering, formatting) without going into the game engine.
- Options class/system, some place to read values that the player chooses
- commonly used vector constants (zero vector, 1 vector, pointing along an axis, etc.)
- better window integration in the game engine.
- centralized "level" or "scene" class that holds the data the game is using.
